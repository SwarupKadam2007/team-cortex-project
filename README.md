🚀 The Problem
Students lose important notes in chaotic WhatsApp groups. We can't search inside PDFs or images, so knowledge gets lost.

💡 The Solution
**Campus Brain** is a simple AI tool. You upload your class PDF, and it uses **Google Gemini** to answer questions. It's like "Ctrl+F" for your whole semester.
